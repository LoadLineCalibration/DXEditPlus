# DXEditPlus
An attempt to recreate better level editor for Deus Ex.

Extended/Improved features I've already implemented:
* High-precision texture rotation. The minimal step is 0.001°
* Startup check. Check if all EditPackages are exist, so we can safely contiunue loading the editor.
* Search in Class Browser.

* Uses FreeEsVCLComponents: https://github.com/errorcalc/FreeEsVclComponents
* Uses JEDI VCL: https://github.com/project-jedi/jvcl
* ToDo: decide with other components.


Right now I'm learning how it works.
